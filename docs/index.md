## Authentication

All requests require an API key.  
You can create and manage keys from your [Promptly Dashboard](https://dashboard.promptly.ai).

Authentication is handled via **Bearer tokens** in the `Authorization` header:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.promptly.ai/v1/text/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Write a motivational quote about innovation."
  }'
```
### Authentication Flow

For a visual of how API key validation works:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Promptly API
    participant S as Auth Server

    U->>A: Send API Key
    A->>S: Validate API Key
    S-->>A: Validation Result (200 OK / 401 Unauthorized)
    A-->>U: Response
```

## Next Steps
